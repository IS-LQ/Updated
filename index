  <section id="focus">
    <h2>Our Focus</h2>
    <p><strong>Simple, smart microbial sensing</strong></p>
    <p>We create user-friendly, plug-and-play sensors that anyone can operate without technical expertise. These devices are affordable and reliable, enabling real-time, on-site water testing for individuals and communities alike. Our technology eliminates traditional barriers to microbial testing, making clean water monitoring practical and widely available.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What We Intend to Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop AI-driven rapid bacterial detection systems with zero energy or media needs.</li>
      <li>Deliver portable and autonomous sensors for water quality monitoring.</li>
      <li>Expand our innovations into healthcare diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="global">
    <h2>Global R&D in Smart Water Sensing</h2>
    <p>Innovations around the world are revolutionizing how we detect and analyze water quality in real time. These advances use a blend of AI, microfluidics, spectroscopy, and edge computing — enabling fast, low-cost, smart, and field-deployable water sensors. Our work embraces these global trends, tailoring solutions specifically for India’s water safety challenges.</p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Institutes like MIT and Stanford have developed AI algorithms that classify waterborne bacteria rapidly and accurately using spectral and imaging data. These models enable real-time detection, drastically reducing the time needed for water quality assessments compared to traditional lab tests.</p>

    <h3>Microfluidics</h3>
    <p>Institutions like ETH Zurich and India’s IITs are pioneering microfluidic chips — tiny devices that manipulate minute amounts of fluids for bacterial analysis. These chips offer rapid, low-cost, and portable testing capabilities suitable for on-site deployment.</p>

    <h3>Spectroscopy (UVs & Hyperspectral Sensors)</h3>
    <p>Advanced spectroscopy techniques enable non-destructive, on-site detection of contaminants by analyzing light absorption and scattering patterns. UVs, UV-VIS and hyperspectral sensors can identify bacteria and pathogens based on their unique optical signatures.</p>

    <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
    <p>Edge computing processes the data locally on the sensor device, reducing latency and the need for cloud connectivity. This is critical for remote or underserved areas where internet access may be unreliable, ensuring fast, autonomous water quality monitoring.</p>
